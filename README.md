Library for Liyab Basic Microcontroller

The Author of this library is our founder, John David Golenia

This repository is intended for the Liyab Basic Microcontroller produced by GearTech Robots Trading (Formerly The Gear Concept). It is a **library board** intended for practice of C++, algorithms, logic statements, embedded systems and robotics. This library was made to make robotics a lot more user-friendly for beginners.

This library is still constantly improving and edited. The company and the author will do its very best to update the capabilities of the microcontroller. We apologize for any mistakes and confusions with the library.
